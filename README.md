# YoungHome
A collection of groovy scripts used to controll my home automation.
Groovy is the language used for the smartthings controller.
Some automation may be existing on an outer topography, using IFTTT combined with other services.
Will also include any additional resources (e.g. images) or APIs to control services, such as voice control.
